# Time-Travel Playground

## About
"Where we are going, we don't need roads."

Redux boasts of a time-travel feature, this repo is meant to explore how that works and how it can be leveraged it to allow for design of new UI components.

At the moment, the application asks three questions which require typed responses.  Redux DevTools time travel allows to replay each keystroke and submit responses.

## Build It

0. Install the Chrome plugin [Redux DevTools](https://github.com/zalmoxisus/redux-devtools-extension)
1. `npm install`
2. `npm start`

## Use It

1. Use the app!  Type in some answers, check them. The 'correct' answers are hard coded in `exercise.js`.
2. Open the Redux DevTools plugin and replay everything you just entered! Even inspecting the state of the application at different moments.
