#Time-Travel Playground 

##About
Where we are going, we don't need roads.

Redux boasts of a time-travel feature, this repo is meant to explore how that works and how we can leverage it to allow for design of new UI components.

At the moment, the application asks three questions which require typed responses.  Time travel allows to replay each keystroke and submit responses.

Time-travel functionality can be explored with a browser plugin [here](https://github.com/zalmoxisus/redux-devtools-extension)

This repo also serves as a basic example of a React, Redux, Webpack application.

## Build It

1. `npm install`
2. `webpack-dev-server --content-base build/`
3. visit `http://localhost:8080/`
